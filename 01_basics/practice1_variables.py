#GOAL: Learn variable naming conventions and constants

#Snake case variable naming
friend_age = 25

#Constant (by convention)
PI = 3.14159

#Printing the values in the variable
print(friend_age)
print(PI)

"""
EXPLANATION:
- Snake case uses underscores
- Constants are written in upper case
- Python allows changing constants but it is discouraged
